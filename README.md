# Kung Fu

First there was

    attachment_fu

Then came

    metric_fu

Then

    permalink_fu

And

    subdomain-fu

And

    job_fu

And then shit started getting crazy

    fu_fu

And then it just got out of control. At last count a "_fu" search nets *323* repositories!

But nobody thought to take it back to the roots!

Thus, I give you!

    kung_fu
